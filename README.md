# Airbnb Industry Project

**Overview**

This project was a collaboration with Airbnb to explore how user data can be leveraged to improve their recommendation system. By analyzing listing data and applying machine learning techniques, we developed a scalable solution that enhances personalized recommendations for users.


***Key Features***

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Identified patterns and insights from Airbnb listing data, focusing on features like location, pricing, reviews, and amenities.
Conducted clustering analysis to group similar listings for better segmentation and recommendations.

Recommendation Model Architecture:

Designed the architecture for a machine learning-powered recommendation system.
Focused on scalability and real-time adaptability for personalized user experiences.

React-Based Demo:

Built a demo to showcase the recommendation model in action.
Simulated how Airbnb users could interact with improved recommendation features.

Figma-Designed Interfaces:

Created high-fidelity interface prototypes in Figma.
Focused on intuitive and user-friendly designs to ensure seamless user experience.


***Technologies Used***

Programming: Python, JavaScript (React)
EDA and Modeling: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
Clustering: K-Means, DBSCAN

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Frontend Development: React
Design and Prototyping: Figma


**Goals Achieved**

Improved Airbnb’s ability to leverage user data for personalized recommendations.
Demonstrated a practical implementation of the recommendation system through a functional demo.
Delivered actionable insights with a focus on scalability and user-centric design.
